          People often ask me what my favorite tech stack is, and my answer is usually the one I'm currently working with. I believe a great engineer isn't defined by one set of tools, but by their ability to learn quickly and solve problems. I take joy in picking up new technologies, and I’m eager to find an opportunity where I can apply my skills and keep growing.
          {/* I've often been asked the question of what is my favorite "tech stack"? My answers would always be the tech stack that my current projects uses. Because it is even more important for an engineer to have the capacity to continue learning and apply their problem solving skills to everyday problems. Not just focusing on one "tech stack". <br/>  As an engineer, I am a self-starter and I take joy in learning new things, but most importantly I am a problem solver. Which is why I am excited about opportunities where I can demonstrate my technical skills and continue to grow as an engineer. */}
