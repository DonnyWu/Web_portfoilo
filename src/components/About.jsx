             I graduated from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 2020. Since then I've been actively pursing full-stack development weather that may be from my job or personal projects, there is always something to learn! Throughout my journey as a software engineer I've been in of all part of the software development lifecycle. Which taught me the invaluable lesson of it takes more than just coding ability to be a great engineer. But also through the use of good design, coding standards, and QA testing. Which are just as imporant for an engineer to understand.
